## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Boston, MA.

For this project, I was interestested in using airbnb data from 2008 to better understand:

1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Boston? By how much do prices spike?
2. Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Boston?
3. Can you describe the vibe of each Boston neighborhood using listing descriptions?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711 TODO).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
